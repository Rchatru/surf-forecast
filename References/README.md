### 1. Create your own surf forecast

You probably track open ocean weather systems using satellite photos, models, and have a good intuitive sense of which storms or conditions have capacity to generate a swell. But once the system is forecast or actually forms, how can you increase certainty that a swell will be headed your way? And how can you predict when that swell will hit?

[Here's](http://www.stormsurf.com/page2/papers/papers.shtml) a step-by-step process to help answer those questions.
