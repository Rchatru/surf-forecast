# Mareas Telegram Bot

This is a simple Telegram bot that extracts tide timetable data from the [tideschart.com](https://es.tideschart.com/) and [tablademareas.com](https://tablademareas.com) websites, formats it into a small, summary message that auto-sends* itself to a personal Telegram chat each day in the morning.

Example message:

**Everyone chooses the method that suits him/her best. In this case the script is executed every day from a remote server.*
